You can focus on that as well. Since earnings season comes around every quarter, it\u2019s one of the most reliable things in the market\u2026\nAnd with Danielle\u2019s proven formula, you\u2019ll discover there\u2019s opportunity everywhere.\n\n\n\nUsing her time-tested formula, Danielle nails quarterly gains, no matter what goes on in the overall markets.

This, paired with the stats tool, gives traders both a visual and numerical set of statistics to identify trades. Volatility is a critical part of trading this season, so these tools go together but they are made separately as the first one goes on the top part of the chart and the second on the bottom.\n\nThis tool gives traders the statistics they absolutely need to identify.

His intimate knowledge of how institutional volume really moves these markets gives him a serious edge over retail players. And the biggest edge of all is knowing how to only target the biggest trends while avoiding all the fake moves that wiped out so many traders\u2019 accounts.\r\n\r\nIn this class, you will discover how Joe repeatedly doubles and triples his capital (and more) on \u201cblack and white\u201d objective setups. With Joe's direction, you\u2019ll develop a fundamental edge over every other retail trader who doesn\u2019t know how to identify the market-moving volume. Plus, you\u2019ll get Joe\u2019s chart layout and training on how he uses three simple indicators that are included in most computer charting programs.\n\nE-Learning Module\n\nAlso part of this package is the E-Learning Module which presents all the important sections of the course in video modules that are organized into specific training topics.\r\n\r\nThis system allows you to follow the course in bite-sized segments on your computer, tablet, or smartphone.

DynaRange was built by Simpler\u2019s own David Starr with the goal of answering that question. \nDynaRange\u00aeis built on the idea that price swings terminate at inflection points in momentum. When momentum slows it may precede a change in direction. The DynaRange indicator shows us projected swing targets based on this calculation of price momentum and allows us to exit a trade before it becomes obvious to the market that momentum has slowed and the trend reverses..\n\nThe combination of these two indicators provides us with both a price target and an underlying measure of momentum via the RAF indicator. \nCombining these indicators shows traders momentum turning points and profit targets in a market before it becomes apparent to everybody else. \nWe want to buy when the DynaRange indicator is at a projected level of support and when Ready Aim Fire is oversold or registering a buy signal at a DynaRange support level. \nWe want to sell when the DynaRange indicator is at a projected level of resistance and when Ready Aim Fire is overbought or registering a sell signal at a DynaRange resistance level.\n\nDay and Swing Traders\n\n/h3 Receive Your Indicator Today:\n\nDynaRange\u00ae Indicator\n\nDavid Starr's indicator he's using in order to get in earlier on more powerful and faster moves.\n\n1 session of recorded live-trading w/ David Starr\n\nThe sessions shows how David goes about using the indicator in a real time environment. \n\nIndicator Setup\n\nIndicator installation session with David Star himself. \n\nLifetime Updates and Live Tech Support\n\nAny future updates will be sent out to these clients; in addtion to that, they can always call our support team for assistance. \n\nDynaRange Indicator  Testimonials: \n\n\"Gratitude .... @dstarr ...your"}

Good news, as John Carter has proven in his 25 plus year career, you only need to master a few simple core concepts to understand how to trade options. John and Henry will share simple strategies designed to help even the newest trader to exploit the incredible profit potential of leveraged options. As part of this lesson, you\u2019ll discover how to spot high probability opportunities.\n\nDiscover how it\u2019s possible to be consistently profitable, even if you\u2019re wrong about market direction most of the time. You\u2019ll discover fundamental spread trades that are really basic versions of the most powerful advanced strategies. You\u2019ll discover why spreads offer the potential for steady account growth with low risk and peace of mind. John and Henry have already made just about every mistake imaginable when it comes to options (so you shouldn\u2019t have to). Before you put on another position, learn how to avoid the account-destroying mistakes that most traders have to learn the hard way. One of the most crucial parts of successful trading is money management. Once again, you can forget complex theories because John will share the simple techniques he\u2019s refined over more than 25 years.\n\nFollow along for two live-sessions as John and Henry help you identify the setups discussed on Saturday. While we can\u2019t offer any guarantee, our informal goal is to make enough trading small positions to recoup the entire cost of the class\u2026 and then some. \n\nSimpler Options 101 Testimonials: \n\nSimpler Options 101 Frequently Asked Questions: \n\n"}
