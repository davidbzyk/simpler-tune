Stop missing big runaway moves when the market takes off

The 10x trading formula is the proven strategy John has refined over more than 25 years. It provides clear direction into learning simple option setups designed specifically to track big, fast moves in the market.

The 10x Bars Indicator identifies explosive buy setups, implosion sell setups, and avoids “head fakes” within congestion zones of volatile markets. Plus, know when volume is at least 50% above average to identify moves with home run potential.

Use 10x Bars to get in earlier on more, bigger, and faster setups. Trade anything with 10x Bars: Stocks, Futures, Options.

As part of his latest 10x course offering, John has developed “The New Multi-10X on Steroids.” This addition is the perfect complement to the original 10x trading formula and indicator.

And now Multi-10X reveals trend direction and strength in 18 time frames. This is invaluable for pinpointing entries in fast runaway breakout moves. Plus, together with the new Reversal Arrows, the new Multi-10X Indicator aims to catch reversals right when they start. This multiple timeframe approach identifies better entries and exits and allows for tighter stops.

Multi-10X is designed to always keep trading in line with the big money flow. You get simple and intuitive colored bars to help you identify trend direction and conviction at a glance.

Let the arrows point the way to spotting stronger support and resistance levels.","The True Low Indicator is designed to identify the “best” price to buy a stock and buy as close to “True Low” prices as possible..

This breakthrough tool uses Allison’s proprietary formula to identify when a stock has finished falling and is positioned to rally. Along with the ability to signal the lowest prices, Allison uses the indicator to help keep her from buying a falling stock too early.","This is your opportunity to follow David and Neil as they use their breakthrough system to automatically identify entries, exits, and stops on any chart.

The market’s been pretty complex lately. Everyone’s either fighting against the fear of missing out (FOMO) while looking for more clarity on their charts.

That's why these two expert traders want to show you how they’ve been able to comfortably get in and out of short-term intraday trades (without having to “wing it”).","The core of the VWAPMax indicator is the display of the volume weighted average price. The VWAP is designed to show at a glance the average price level of participants involved in the market selling. Heavier volume at certain price points drags the VWAP closer to that price whereas, light volume trading has far less “pull.”

Additionally, the VWAPMax indicator displays an envelope around the VWAP, which represents the theoretical maximum permissible deviation away from the VWAP. Available for ThinkorSwim and TradingView.","The Phoenix Finder Tool reveals the hidden power in any ticker in any sector you choose. 

This enables you to analyze and trade sectors, ETFs, or individual stocks. With the Phoenix Finder’s “birds eye view”, it’s possible to objectively measure the strength of each symbol. The goal is to help you pick the best stock in each sector, and put your money on the hottest  stock (or short the weakest).","The TurboVZO volume and momentum indicator, and is one of Danielle Shay’s favorite indicators. This indicator tells you when confirmed volume moves are happening, and thus allows you to jump on for the ride

In addition to providing ideal entry signals, it also helps you exit trades based on the same equation. This is an ideal entry and exit indicator that’s the cherry on top of the strategy discussed in this class. The equation that’s built into this indicator came from several years of Danielle using the Volume Zone Oscillator. She built off that formula and upgraded it with additional math to produce usable signals (while making it more user friendly).

The TurboVZO pairs perfectly with Danielle’s TrendStrength Candles 2.0.","The Divergent Bar identify if a trader will see a potential higher high or lower low within the next three bars. On a daily chart, this means seeing a higher high and lower low within the next 3 days. This signal is great for taking on short-term trades you may only hold overnight.

Allison Ostrander’s simple formula can be used in up, down, and consolidating markets on almost any chart or time frame. It can even work on new IPO stocks because it only needs a few bars to identify opportunities. Allison loves this indicator because it helps her predict what the following bar could do. Allison has found this pattern to be especially powerful when combined with her options setups.",,"This is a new limited time offer for David Starr's Voodoo Lines® indicator. Use the tools that almost every trader on the Simpler Team swears by in order to predict the support and resistance levels where the market will turn. While other traders get stopped out by fakeouts, or enter too late, you can catch moves before they happen! We call them Voodoo Lines® because the underlying techniques are based on Fibonacci analysis and Elliott waves – dark arts to some. But don’t worry, you don’t need to need to know a thing about Elliott waves or Fibonacci levels to incorporate the power of the Voodoo into your trading; The Voodoo Lines® do the work for you. Futures version of the indicator requires no subscription.","Right now there’s more opportunity than ever in the market. And yet the market is moving faster than ever, too. If you want to catch the big moves you can’t be late or you’ve missed them. Truth is, it’s almost impossible to watch every stock on your watchlist in every important timeframe to spot the most explosive moves early. 
/h3 That’s Why John Carter Created the New Multi Squeeze Pro. 
It is designed to identify Squeeze setups across 18 timeframes and it’s been a total game changer since it was first released. It’s helped John Carter break every past profit record. It let him catch his biggest AMZN trade (so far), a monster $611,395 gain. 
That trade would have been ‘hidden’ without the Multi-Squeeze Pro. This breakthrough finally makes it possible to spot ALL 3 Squeeze Pro setups across ALL 18 timeframes. This simply wasn’t possible before now (unless you painstakingly examined 18 separate charts). It means missed opportunities because no one has the time to do that.
Now imagine being able to see exactly when the strongest ‘squeezes’ are all lined up and ready to explode — at a glance. This insight is more important than ever during volatile market conditions! 
With this strategy and this indicator, John recently banked $216k in TSLA, $219k in NFLX, on top of the record $611k in AMZN.","The Volume Max indicator analyzes price and volume to help traders clarify market sentiment. This custom version compares short term and long term VWAP as well as an ‘anchored’ VWAP, moving VWAP, and intraday VWAP, and combines price, time, and volume. It’s designed to reveal continuation setups in up or down markets.","This tool goes with the Earnings Volatility Indicator for the complete package. Volatility is a critical part of trading during every earnings season. This tool gives traders the essential statistics to measure the profit potential in earnings trades. It identifies these potentially profitable setups, in addition to giving traders critical information, such as previous quarter analysis, dollar and percentage moves, actual versus expected moves, trends, and so much more! This tool is an incredible time-saver when combined with the Quarterly Profits Formula as it speeds up the process of finding Danielle’s favorite setups. Danielle wouldn’t trade earnings without this tool now. The Earnings Hot Zone is designed to help you during the ‘Run into Earnings,’ actual Earnings Season, as well as post-Earnings moves that you may otherwise miss. This tool will also include a general indicator install pre-recorded video to make sure your indicator is in “tip-top” shape, and that you’re ready to hit the ground running for the class and any live trading sessions.","The 10x Bars Indicator is used to quickly understand the trend quality and strength on any chart at a glance. Based on a calculation of the ADX and DMI, the 10x Bars combines and simplifies the analysis from these powerful indicators. The goal is to make trading decisions simpler. Combining the information from 10x Bars with volume further strengthens the signal because, as John Carter says, “Momentum + volume is magic.” The 10x Bars are an excellent complement to the Squeeze because they are designed to confirm when a trend is strong. And when a trend is weak, it can serve as an early warning to GTFO (Get The Funds Out). The 10x Bars will plot green, yellow, or red based on the underlying calculation of the ADX and DMI indicators.","What if you could end your trading day in a matter of minutes? Can you really have a “full” trading day in under an hour? Our Director of Weekly Options Strategies, Kody Ashmore, grew his account by over 60% in 3 months doing just that, and now, he’s sharing his 1% per day strategy with you in this step-by-step interactive training 

Using 0DTE expiration options, Kody has been able to put on a trade within the first 15-20 minutes of the trading day, leave it alone, and revisit it at the end of the day with the goal of receiving a minimum of 1% of his account value for the trade. His day starts with choosing where he thinks the market will NOT go (his bias), placing the trade, and stepping away to take care of whatever else needs to be dealt with.

This strategy requires no scanning, no setup determination, and little to no drama as a result. You’re in and out within the same day, so there’s no overnight risk, and you can have as little as $1,000 in your account and still take advantage of Kody’s 1% per day strategy. He’s been able to take it to even greater heights, as he’s used this trading strategy in both his $25K account and $100K account because the principles are the same. Once you learn this strategy, you can apply it to your own trading style.","This is a new limited time offer for David Starr's DynaRange® indicator. Use the tools he's using in order to get in earlier on more powerful and faster moves. “Where will this move top out?” is a common question asked by traders. DynaRange was built by Simpler’s own David Starr with the goal of answering that question. 
DynaRange®is built on the idea that price swings terminate at inflection points in momentum. When momentum slows it may precede a change in direction. The DynaRange indicator shows us projected swing targets based on this calculation of price momentum and allows us to exit a trade before it becomes obvious to the market that momentum has slowed and the trend reverses..","Most options training is confusing because it’s chock full of complex academic theory and jargon. Good news, as John Carter has proven in his 25 plus year career, you only need to master a few simple core concepts to understand how to trade options. John and Henry will share simple strategies designed to help even the newest trader to exploit the incredible profit potential of leveraged options. As part of this lesson, you’ll discover how to spot high probability opportunities.

Discover how it’s possible to be consistently profitable, even if you’re wrong about market direction most of the time. You’ll discover fundamental spread trades that are really basic versions of the most powerful advanced strategies. You’ll discover why spreads offer the potential for steady account growth with low risk and peace of mind. John and Henry have already made just about every mistake imaginable when it comes to options (so you shouldn’t have to). Before you put on another position, learn how to avoid the account-destroying mistakes that most traders have to learn the hard way. One of the most crucial parts of successful trading is money management. Once again, you can forget complex theories because John will share the simple techniques he’s refined over more than 25 years.

Follow along for two live-sessions as John and Henry help you identify the setups discussed on Saturday. While we can’t offer any guarantee, our informal goal is to make enough trading small positions to recoup the entire cost of the class… and then some. ","HOW DO WE USE IT?

These stats are available for EACH Squeeze Pro level on any chart at a glance. This makes it possible to anticipate the potential reward to help guide you in trade selection and management – based on actual data specific to the chart you are viewing.

To conduct the challenge, Taylor will share his A+ setups so members can follow along in real-time",There are two things you can count on even in the most unpredictable markets: Companies report earnings every quarter and most options buyers lose money gambling on which way the stocks will move.

As you can see, it’s possible to “win” even if you just hit the side of a barn.

Why? The strategy thrives on volatility.

In fact, it’s winning BECAUSE most traders lose in an uncertain market.

That’s how it’s possible to literally “profit from panic.”

These trades open with a credit and have an 86% (or greater) chance of pocketing an even bigger credit when you exit.

Even better — because this strategy can profit across a wide price range, it’s an almost ‘zero stress’ way to generate consistent cash flow.

Unbalanced Flys can make even higher returns when price “pins” at your target. By knowing when to hold ‘em, it’s possible to cash in this “lotto” ticket potential.

As you saw on that AAPL trade, a little patience was worth close to 100% greater gains…

Henry credits this ONE setup as his real “bread and butter” strategy. With the Unbalanced Butterfly course, you can learn exactly when to use this powerful setup.","Using her time-tested formula, Danielle nails quarterly gains, no matter what goes on in the overall markets.

The trade had zero downside risk if TLT kept falling because of the strategy used. Even better, this trade had an 89% chance of being profitable.

Sure enough, by the time the trade was closed, it delivered a profit equal to 100% of the initial credit. That means Henry essentially got paid to take this trade and got to keep the money.

Butterfly Trade Yields $8.50 Per Contract of PLTR ($850)
[Chart Image]

Danielle bought a butterfly for $1.12/contract ($112) and sold the butterfly for $8.50/contract ($850). When she entered the trade, she was targeting $30.
[Chart Image]
This butterfly had a good risk to reward ratio and was also really cheap. Danielle figured it would work better than a longer-dated fly if it triggered quickly. Sometimes, like here, she takes two flies because she can never know exactly when a target will be hit.


189% Profit in Chegg (CHGG)
[Chart Image]
In this CHGG trade, Danielle bought a butterfly at $1.70/contract ($170) and exited at $4.75/contract ($475), and made 189% profit.

[Chart Image]
The idea behind these 2 contracts was a combination of an earnings trade and post-earnings trade. The Hot Zone showed Danielle that CHGG had been beating earnings, and has a tendency to explode post-earnings, so she wanted to place a low-priced butterfly that had a great risk to reward ratio to trade the earnings report. Her intention was to look for a blowout report and use that earnings move as a catalyst, which worked out great. She got into her fly right before market close and CHGG had a fantastic report - Danielle was able to take quick profits there.",,,,,,"As the name suggests, the goal is to anticipate when momentum is about to turn AND when a Squeeze is about to fire.

The Phoenix Finder Indicator is Danielle’s popular research tool. Instead of spending hours searching for a needle in a haystack, this breakthrough tool makes it possible to find the strongest stocks and sectors within minutes!

The previous Phoenix Finder compared the strength and weakness of the trend and allowed traders to be able to easily see the shifts in the trend. This ‘boosted’ version uses that same technology and more.

What do we mean by “and more?”

The Phoenix Finder Turbo also incorporates volume, a critical component when trading momentum, especially in a volatile market. Big money is making big moves and those moves are reflected in the increased volume that pours in. When volume is pouring in, the Phoenix Turbo alerts traders by ‘lighting up.’ This shows that big money is making big moves.

The Phoenix Turbo uses one-of-a-kind technology to compare the strength of the trend across hand-selected grids known as the Phoenix Folios so that traders can quickly and objectively determine which way money is flowing. As retail traders, we don’t have the ability to move markets with billions of dollars like hedge funds do, but we can identify and follow their moves and ride alongside them by quantifying the trend of a chart, taking volume into consideration, and using tools to jump on the trends as they shift.

Additionally, The Phoenix Turbo comes with Danielle’s hand-picked stock mines, also known as her Phoenix Folios. These are Danielle’s pre-selected Phoenix grids that she uses to find her best trade selections.

For the first time, Joe Rokop, Managing Director of Commodities and Equities at Simpler Trading, revealed his “Volume Breakout System.” It’s the result of 15 years of in-the-trenches experience that originated on the New York Mercantile Exchange Trading Floor.
