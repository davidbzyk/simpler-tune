Even in markets with wild price swings, this bulletproof strategy is the \u201csecret sauce\u201d to collecting premium quickly in a variety of volatile market conditions.\n\nIn fact, check out the volatility in this $1,600 SPX trade\u2026 \n\n[chart]\n\nAs you can see, that quick gain was locked in over FOUR days. That\u2019s a pretty typical turnaround for this strategy. That\u2019s because this strategy which uses \u201cbulletproof\u201d butterflies specifically targets quick weekly income.\n\nThe best part is that you don\u2019t need complex formulas or any custom indicators\u2026\n\n/h2 What if you had ONE strategy for \"all\" market conditions?\n\nAs Senior Director of Options and Income Trading at Simpler Trading, Bruce Marshall, has demonstrated how it\u2019s possible to continue to produce \u201cbulletproof\u201d weekly income with this one strategy in our trading rooms.\n\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s agreed to do this Bulletproof Butterflies 2.0 training to walk you through exactly what he\u2019s doing while also showing you how it works in real-time. This strategy has worked great for Bruce on its own as well as in addition to other strategies in \u201call\u201d market conditions."}

If you want to catch the big moves you can\u2019t be late or you\u2019ve missed them. Truth is, it\u2019s almost impossible to watch every stock on your watchlist in every important timeframe to spot the most explosive moves early. \n/h3 That\u2019s Why John Carter Created the New Multi Squeeze Pro. \nIt is designed to identify Squeeze setups across 18 timeframes and it\u2019s been a total game changer since it was first released. It\u2019s helped John Carter break every past profit record. It let him catch his biggest AMZN trade (so far), a monster $611,395 gain. \nThat trade would have been \u2018hidden\u2019 without the Multi-Squeeze Pro. This breakthrough finally makes it possible to spot ALL 3 Squeeze Pro setups across ALL 18 timeframes.
